# Wikibase Query Service GUI

This repository contains the GUI for [query.bahaidata.org](https://query.bahaidata.org/), it is a fork of [wikidata-query-gui](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikidata-query-gui). The purpose of the fork was primarily to customize QuerySamples.js so that the service would be compatible with bahaidata, and keep track of other changes. 

This code lives at https://github.com/bahaipedia/bahaidata-query-gui and changes should be made there.
